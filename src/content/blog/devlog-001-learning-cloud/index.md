It's been some time since I've done anything on this website. So I felt like it was time to do some updates to this web.

# The path to cloud
As it's being said, I've been learning cloud because:
1. My job requires me to do so
2. I want to make a home server to centralize my data on a point

This being said, I can recommend a few resources. The guide from the guys of [learn2cloud](https://learntocloud.guide/) it's a good start point to get on the basics. What I like about it, it's that it tries to get you hands on projects that you could learn from.

Also, I'll like to mention the roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) for the DevOps Engineering roadmap. 

# My personal recommendations
As I get more deep into this, the more I realize my university failed me into teaching (or more like, I failed myself into learning these. lol) the basics of basic networking and unix based system administration. The stuff that I highly recommend don't skip is:
- Basic bash scripting.
- 101 of Networking.
- Software and Network architecture.
- Learning how to properly code.
- Getting used to a shell.
- _GIT_.
- Virtual environments (Docker or/and Nix).
- How to _unfuck_ a fucked up server.

# What's ahead for me?
I have some stuff I got to work on before I can move on the next big thing. But my current planned project I'll do is:
- Set up a local linux machine.
- Start looking on how to run properly run a panel where I can run all the apps I want to use.
- Mirror a local gitea server into github.
- Move all the stuff on my google drive into a NAS.
- Start learning IoT.
- Expand all of this on a K8s or K3s cluster with scrap machines I find.
